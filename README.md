iOS For Designers on Codepath

Week 1: Facebook

This is my homework for the first week of iOS for Designers on Codepath. It uses tab bar controllers, scroll view, compose view, back button, and a keyboard.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

Milestones

Required: Setup
Required: Tab bar controllers
Required: Scrollable views
Required: Story Detail View
Required: Posting
Bonus: "In the story detail view, tapping in the text field should bring up the keyboard and animate the text field above the keyboard." (Did not complete second bonus task)

Notes: Had difficulty in the initial setup, where I created an OSX app instead of an iOS app, which is why my homework is late.
